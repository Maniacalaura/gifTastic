Homework 6 GIPHY API
This is a "How Are You Feeling Today?" gif generator!

Using the Giphy API, it pulls gifs that represent how you're feeling. If your feeling isn't displayed, simply type it into the text box!

The new feeling will be added to the buttons.

Gifs will load still, and animate on click. They also stop on click.

The ratings have been limited to G & PG, because this is a family site! 

It will load 10 gifs for you to choose from.
